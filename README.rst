Comments moderation is implemented with involvement of two stage workflow.
Comments are created in "private" state and visible only to DiscussionManager
group of users.

To differentiate between logged-in (registered) commentors and Anonymous
commentors that pretend to be one person or other one, we use Boldness of
name. The Comment author is in bold when posted by logged in member. The
names provided when posting Anonymously are in plain text.

Notification subject control allows to enter custom prefix to distinct
notifications coming from different sites.
